    <p>Pookie Iron Man isn’t your average superhero—he’s the Tony Stark of the snack aisle. Picture this: a slightly overweight, snack-obsessed genius who built his suit out of aluminum foil, duct tape, and an old microwave. Instead of arc reactors, his suit runs on potato chips and pure caffeine. His weapons? A ketchup blaster and a soda grenade launcher. Villains don’t stand a chance against his ultimate move: the *“Nacho Slam,”* where he rains molten cheese on their heads. But don’t let his love for food fool you—Pookie Iron Man always saves the day… as long as it doesn’t interfere with taco night!</p>
